# Web-Project

It is a python based web application which helps beginner programmers as well as experienced ones to find a job.

You can register as a customer to create new orders or as a programmer to complete these tasks.
Programmers can authorize using their github accounts. They can find suitable order by choosing their strongest languages and areas.
Each programmer has his rating - assessments from customers after order completion.

There is also an admin user who is checking programmer's and customer order's descriptions and has an opportunity to add new languages and areas to the database.
